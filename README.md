# Semantic_Similarity
Web site produced for SE 640 and Dr. Maninder Singh with group members Sharatha Jayakumar and Keshav Singhal.

Our goal is to clarify and assist requirements analysis.  Requirements documents can be uploaded, analyzed, and edited.  The emphasis is on the semantic similarities among requirements.
If you edit one requirement, how will it affect the rest?  If you can analyze which requirements have similarities, the process of finding affected requirements will be much easier to 
amend.  Our goal was to be able to analyze requirements in an SRS document, highlight semantically similar requirements, be able to edit and save them for a more complete set of requirements.
A python program to give a graphical interpretation of the requirement's similarities, written by Dr. Maninder Singh, was also included.
